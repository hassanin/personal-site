# The Journey of a Passionate Software Engineer

Mohamed's fascination with computers began at a young age. He still remembers the excitement of programming his first "Hello World" application. This passion only grew stronger as he pursued his Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering at the American University in Cairo.

After graduating magna cum laude, Mohamed took his first role as a Software Development Engineer at Mentor Graphics. He honed his skills developing behavioral modeling prototypes and VHDL/Verilog templates. This position showed Mohamed the thrill of building software from the ground up.

Eager to push his boundaries, Mohamed moved to the University of Delaware for graduate school. Over the next 5 years, he earned his Master's and Doctorate degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Mohamed published several papers and patented new techniques in communications and information theory.

Armed with advanced qualifications, Mohamed was ready to join the industry as an expert. He took on roles at MathWorks and Akamai Technologies as a senior software engineer. Mohamed led teams, launched products, and published more influential papers. His specialty was developing distributed systems and cloud infrastructure.

Today, Mohamed brings nearly a decade of diverse software engineering experience. While he enjoys designing complex systems, his true passion is using technology to solve real-world problems. Mohamed hopes to continue growing as an engineer and mentor for those around him. Most of all, he wants to keep that child-like curiosity that started his journey. There are always new "Hello World" programs to write.
